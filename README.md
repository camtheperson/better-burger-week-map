## 📊 Data Source

Data is scraped from the official [Portland Mercury's Burger Week 2025](https://everout.com/portland/events/the-portland-mercurys-burger-week-2025/e205791/) listing on EverOut. The scraper:

1. Fetches the main burger week page
2. Extracts restaurant names, burger names, and neighborhoods
3. Scrapes individual restaurant pages for descriptions, addresses, and hours
4. Geocodes addresses to get map coordinates using Google Maps API
5. Saves all data to JSON files

### ⚠️ Important Notes about Geocoding

- **Coordinates are already included**: The repository contains pre-geocoded coordinates for all restaurants
- **GitHub Actions doesn't run geocoding**: To preserve coordinates and avoid API costs, automated deployments skip the geocoding step
- **Manual geocoding**: If you need to re-geocode, set `GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY` environment variable and run `npm run google-geocode`
- **Coordinate preservation**: The scraper automatically preserves existing coordinates when updating restaurant data

## 🔄 Automated Updates

The site automatically updates daily at 8 AM UTC using GitHub Actions. This ensures the map always has the latest information about participating restaurants.
